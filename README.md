<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Dynamic Professional README Generator

![Project Blog Post Demo](/DemoREADMEGenerator.gif)


This project was about highlighting the importance of high-quality README document. One way of efficiently creating one is by generating one through a command-line application. 

Here's why we're doing this:
* Understand how to create a command-line application that dynamcally generates a README.md file
* Work with package installations like Inquirer
* Learn how to invoke and run these types of applications
